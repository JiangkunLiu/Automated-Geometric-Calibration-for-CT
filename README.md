# Automated-Geometric-Calibration-for-CT
By Jiangkun Liu
This program automatically find calibration parameters for flat panel detector CT, including detector tilt angle, slant angle,
skew angle, x-direction displacement, z-direction displacement, and source to detector distance.
The data were a set of projection images of scanning a phantom with more than two point-like markers. The program automatically locates
the markers, track their trajectories, and computes those parameters.
